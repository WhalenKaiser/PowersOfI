I'm starting to post my codewars projects, in order to get more projects up on GitHub.  This project is pretty simple, but I'm loading up the test file as well, because it's great to have examples of test driven development up as well.  Also, I'm realizing this is a good example of how I like my code---super readable.  I know the community loves the one line solutions.  I only like those, if I'm using a built in function that really only needs one line.
